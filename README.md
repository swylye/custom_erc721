# Custom ERC721
This is a custom ERC721 with metadata and enumeration extensions. Compared to the OpenZeppelin version, it is more gas efficient as there are only minimal state variables stored.

## Usage
You can refer to [CustomToken.sol](https://github.com/swylye/custom_erc721/blob/main/contracts/CustomToken.sol) for how to implement this. There is also an OpenZeppelin equivalent for comparison ([OZToken.sol](https://github.com/swylye/custom_erc721/blob/main/contracts/OZToken.sol)).
